## Objectives
- ### To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I will create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
- ### To complete a Solidity `JointSavings` smart contract.
- ### Create a folder named `Execution_Results` that contains at least eight images. These images should confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, which are designed to test the `JointSavings` functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.
---

## To Do
- ### [X] Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity.

- ### [X] Compile and Deploy my Contract in the JavaScript VM.

- ### [X] Interact with my Deployed Smart Contract.
